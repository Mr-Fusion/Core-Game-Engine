Game Engine TODO:

- Streamline LoadMedia Functions for various gamestates
	* Centralized Class for sound/Texture files?
	* Load assets on an entity basis?
- Implement levels as sub-loops
	* Need to define loop structure
- Improve font handling
	*gFont may not be deallocating properly
- Re-Implement Bullet in Gameloop
- Look into Entity, Component, System (ECS) Structure
"ECS ("Entity Component System") describes a design approach which promotes code reusability by separating data from behavior. Data is often stored in cache-friendly ways which benefits performance."

Elements from BrickBreak to merge:

- Pickup Class
	* Needs to be made more generic/cleaned up
- WeightedTable Class
- Pause Function
- Menu Options/Configurations
