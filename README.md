# "What is this, exactly?"

This is a boilerplate implementation of the game engine which was used to create some of the other games found on this GitHub account. The main loop and many of the classes are adaptations from Lazy Foo's Game Development Tutorials. As such, the foundation of this game engine and the games which are created with it are intended for educational and entertainment purposes only.

As helpful new features are created during the development of my other game projects, I will strive to merge and refactor the source code back to this repository for the sake of exercising good coding standards/practices, as well as to incorporate lessons learned into a baseline which I can use to launch the development of the next game, whatever it may be.

## Compiling the Project

This game was developed in C++ using SDL 2.0 libraries. I used Lazy Foo's tutorials to get started with this project, and I highly recommend following those tutorials in order to set up an SDL 2.0 environment for your development platform of choice.
